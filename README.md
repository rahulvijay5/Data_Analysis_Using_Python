Analysis of data of diseased people in Kerela - Analysing the role of Endosulfan

This project is based on real tragedy happening in Kasargode District of Kerela.

Where several people are getting infected from an unknown disease and several other consequences. 
Where all the claim is been putting on a pesticide called as Endosulphan.
It is said that due to high use of this pesticide at there, before 2001 people are facing the problems now.

To solve this problem me and my friends are working on data to get the result out of it, whether this claim is true or not using current technology available.

We have a massive dataset of 15,00,000 people residing at various people in Kerela who are infected to this and other diseases also.
Using Ai/Ml and their algorithms in Python language we are trying our best to produce some result out of it. Till now we have calculated the relative z-index by clearing the dataset to our use, and now we are proceeding ahead by talking to a researcher who is currently working on this tragedy actively.
